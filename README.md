# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-for-Synthetic-Traffic-Sign-Generation-
This project uses GANs to generate realistic synthetic traffic sign images from the Belgium Traffic Sign dataset. The synthetic data augments real images to improve autonomous driving model accuracy. Evaluation includes FID score for image quality and classifier performance comparison with and without synthetic data.
